## Vaccine Bioreactor Production
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide, affecting Africa in particular. It is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria and it generally affects the lungs. Tuberculosis is a chronic and slow-onset infectious disease that mainly affects young people. The disease is mainly spread when individuals with active TB cough, spit, speak or sneeze (airborne particles). According to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2022 by the World Health Organisation (WHO), there were 10.6 million new cases of TB worldwide in 2021 and 1.6 million out of these were deaths. In Uganda in particular, in 2021, tuberculosis caused 14 thousand deaths. Tuberculosis deaths have already fallen significantly in recent years due to the World Health Organisation actively promoting the BCG vaccine in Uganda.
The vaccine primarily used against the TB bacteria is the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. For the WHO to be able to offer BCG vaccination in Africa, a sufficient and affordable supply of vaccines is needed, and hence more vaccine plants have to be built.
For the team’s Engineering Challenge 2, the aim was to design a BCG vaccine production plant as part of the BCG vaccine manufacturing facilities in Mbarara, Uganda. As CS-EEE students, the task was to design, develop and test the circuitry, software and interfaces required to remotely monitor and control the parameters of a small-scale bioreactor control system.
